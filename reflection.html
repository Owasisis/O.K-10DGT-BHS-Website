        <p>
            Even though I missed out on a bit of learning at the start of the year, I still learnt a lot and feel confident with the tools I have. I enjoyed 3D modelling the most of all closely followed by animation, Video and D4M in no particular order. Video Game design was fun but the tools we had were very restrictive and limited <br><br>
            I still need to work on the website a fair bit but I like the aesthetic I have going. I'm not exactly sure about the accent colours but there's nothing really wrong with them. Minimalistic and fairly utilitarian. <br><br>
          I've decided to work with Fibitius Chan on the end of year project. We're fairly certain that we're going to do something related to 3D modellng and animation. We're both fairly confident and proficient with our 3D modelling software and are fairly ready to commit to a project for the next 10 weeks. <br>
